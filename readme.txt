With many handy features!== Description ==The WordPress plugin WP Attachments is designed to produce an automatic list of files uploaded in a page, without manually insert the link. This plugin is helpful when there is the need to constantly show many files in posts, pages, and custom post types as well. With this plugin you can avoid to insert an html link in the content every time you upload a file and at the bottom of every page you will automatically find an "Attachments" section which show all the files you uploaded. You can use this also just to create a "file repository" at the end of the content (for example documents or images to download)DEMO: [www.comune.sanpellegrinoterme.bg.it](http://www.comune.sanpellegrinoterme.bg.it/documenti/regolamenti/)Compatible with **pages**, **posts** and **custom post types** as well.= Why should You choose WP Attachments? =This plugin is just another WordPress plugin, but quite different.
